#  Patient Health Monitoring System

An Arduino-based embedded system that continuously monitors a patient's **heart rate**, **SpO2 (blood oxygen level)**, **temperature**, and **humidity**. Designed to support affordable, home-based and remote healthcare solutions.

##  Features

- Real-time heart rate and oxygen saturation monitoring
- Temperature and humidity sensing
- Live output on a 20x4 LCD via I2C interface
- Compact, low-power, and cost-effective design

---

##  How It Works

1. The **MAX30100 sensor** detects heart rate and oxygen levels.
2. The **DHT11 sensor** records temperature and humidity from the environment.
3. The **Arduino Uno** reads data from these sensors in real-time.
4. Results are displayed on a **20x4 LCD screen** using the I2C interface for efficient wiring.
5. All components are mounted inside a small, enclosed setup for usability and portability.
